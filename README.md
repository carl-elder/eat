## About Eat App

Eat App is a web application built on top of Laravel. A long-standing passion project of mine designed to minimize food waste, maximize nutritional intake, and control food budgeting
- A simple to use interface where users can quickly create an inventory off all food they possess
- Smart tools for determining what meals can be made from the food they possess
- APIs quickly source food for meals they can *almost* make from nearby grocers
- Statistic and probability mathematics employed to prioritize using food with shorter shelf-lifes and rapidly approaching expiration dates
- Nutritional preferences (macro and caloric) as well as dietary restrictions and allergens will help guide users to a happier and easier life of eating.

Eat App will be a powerful tool for individual users, and just might change the world... if I can pull it off.
